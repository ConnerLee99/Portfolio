        <h4>Hello and welcome to my webpage.</h4>
        <p>
             
            This is a bit about me. I am a creative person by nature and I love to design. I am an avid musician who loves to play guitar. And have been player for around 6 months, I hope to teach this later in my life. My main hobbies are photography, which I love. And gaming. I did graphic design and computer science in high school which first introduced me to Python, HTML, Photoshop and Illustrator. I further studied graphics and photography at college and it became a strong interest of mine. After college I joined the Princes Trust team program. I did some work experience in graphic design and I knew after that I wanted to pursue a creative career.
            
            Towards the end of the program we had a careers day where I was first introduced to Code Nation. The idea of going back to coding after a few years really interested me. As this would be a very useful thing to know and that I might be able to use in my life, but also it could be something that I really enjoyed.
            
            After starting the course with Code Nation I now know that becoming a developer is a definitely a career I want to pursue. We created a RPG style game as small teams, which was my first attempt at game development. It was tough considering we were all relatively new to coding but after a lot of trial and error we finally got a working game that met our goals when we started. I enjoy coding because it gives me a chance to be creative in a different way than graphics ever could have.

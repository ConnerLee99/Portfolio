        <h4>Review of IT tools</h4>
        <p>Visual studio code has been great for the creation of this website. It has been really convenient to just switch between tabs to be able to code my html and css. The predictive text also allows coding to be quicker, it only saves you a tiny amount of time but over a large scale, this can save you a lot of time. This helps make sure that your syntax is almost always correct. And it also helps you learn and try new things, as I did with the border for my navigation bar. 

            Trello has also been very useful. It has helped me to focus on select things one at a time. And it has helped me to remember any items that I have forgotten to add. It has also been really helpful to keep a tab on what I have done so far. It isn’t as effective on a small project like this but on a larger project this would have been really good to make sure you don’t repeat items.

        </p>

        <h4>How appropriate where the IT tools used</h4>
        <p>I found Visual Studio Code was very useful and easy to use. HTML and CSS have been presented in a really user friendly way which has really helped me to learn the 2 languages in a way will stick. I have learned the basics of these 2 languages in a quick and effective way, which has given me the means to build on these myself. 

            Slack has been a really good tool during this project. It has helped me to stay on target, and for what we need to do to be sent to us all. Its been really good to message some of my class mates just to get an idea of why my code wasn’t working, and to try to find a solution with them. This has also allowed me to revise the design of my website to give it a nice professional look.

        <h4>Strengths and weaknesses of the website</h4>
        <p>I personally like the way I have designed my website so far. I think it has a professional feel to it and that, for the purpose of potentially being hired, it works really well. The dark themed background, mixed with the white text really makes the writing pop and stand out. And the navigation bar at the top gives a really nice aesthetic with it being black and slightly transparent as to see what is underneath it when scrolling. I really like how the python terminal fits into one of the pages, and plays the game in total.

            Obviously we only had a small amount of time to learn and to make our website so I haven’t been able to make it as nice as I would have like. I would have like to added multiple scrolling backgrounds as this gives me a chance to show different aspects of what me and my website is about.

        <h4>Further improvements</h4>
        <p>I would have liked to add some animated parts to my website, such as logos or fades, this would be done using Java script. I have not learnt how to do any Java yet but I do plan to learn this personally as well as on the course.  I would also like to add some references to my other forms of work such as my graphics. As this is what has attributed to what makes me really interested in coding. 

            I would also like to make it so the links that take you to different pages can only be clicked when you are not on that page as doing this at the minute just refreshes the page, this is not a major problem at the minute but or larger sites with deeper pages this could be a problem.

        <h4>Review of outcomes</h4>
        <p>I have looked over each of my outcomes to make sure i have encluded all elements.

        <h4>The benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</h4>
        <p>As Visual Studio Code is very user friendly with its predictive text, I would say its very efficient even for a solo project. It is also very easy to keep up productivity thanks to this as well. I think now that I know the basics of both HTML and CSS I think I would be able to implement more of the ideas that I wanted into my website in the same time frame. Having to both learn the languages and create at the same time was definitely useful for solidly learning the languages, however it definitely slowed things down.

            Also the fact that I had to do this project on my own really limited the scope of my ideas for the website. Giving it a very one way design, having extra members in my team would definitely opened up the possible ideas and aesthetics of the website. Having multiple team members would have allowed me to split different jobs between the team. Making the production of the website more efficient. However this comes with its own set of challenges such as making sure the design of all the pages are along the same line.

        <h4>Ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h4>
        <p>
            Learning all the methods that I am going to use in my website beforehand is a very big way that I could have improved both my efficiency and my productivity. Time management would also help with my efficiency. This would make sure that I get a designated amount of hours per day adding and changing elements around for the website. 
            
            Taking regular breaks would defiantly be a way to improve productivity. Coding constantly and none stop can lead to a burn out, whether that be for new ideas, or to do the basics. Taking breaks and keeping a fresh head is vital to stay on top of your game and to maximise the amount of work you can do to a stand that is acceptable.

        <h4>Solutions to increase productivity and efficiency</h4>
        <p>Next time I would try to  set up with a small team. Establish the goals on Trello, where we could keep tabs and remember what to focus on. And have my own slack channel to stay up to date on what needs adding, this means I can get new ideas from different members and get a consensus on what direction the team what’s to take with certain elements. 

            Being more specific on Trello would also be a way to increase productivity. This would give me exact and thorough goals. It would allow me to devise an exact plan from the start, seeing this all listed out would give me a clear vision of how things might look and where they will go. And this will allow me to build on to this goal more efficiently

        <h4>Testing digital solutions</h4>
        <p>I would test digital solutions by having a small team, having a team gives a fresh set of eyes looking over the same code. This increases the chances of finding any errors that the original coder could have made and over looked. I would make sure that my digital solution works on a multitude of hardware, such as Macs, high end PCs and low end PCs as well. For website based solutions I would try it out on all of the popular web browsers such as chrome, Firefox and safari.</p>

        <h4>The purpose of it in modern business</h4>
        <p>IT is at the centre of any good business. Whether the business is large or tiny they all rely on a trained IT team. From communication in the business itself between coworkers and mangers to leasing with clients to create what they need. Without a infrastructure to do this, many business would would not be able to function at all.  And when these systems go down. It is a team that knows the ins and outs of the system that are there to fix it and keep the business operating. 

            Unless your business is run like its the 60s and you have cabinet upon cabinet full of files. Your data storage is likely to be in the cloud or dedicated servers. It is the job of the IT team to keep this service not only operational but safe and secure. It is all good having a system that works but if it can easily be breached and your data accessed and stolen then the whole system is pointless 
            
            An effective way to boost your business is to keep tabs on your sales, your expenditure and your relationships with customers and other businesses. All this information can be stored and compiled into reports for you to analyse and find ways to boost your productivity and a multitude of other uses like capitalising on new opportunities and streamlining expenditure.

        <h4>Methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully.</h4>
        <p>For a project to be successful you need a clear vision of process. Using Trello you can manage what needs to be done, what is currently being done and what has already been done to make sure you know that you have included all of the necessary items for your project to be successful. Having a set plan for what to do is good however you must also have good time management to utilise the plan to its full. You will never hit deadlines and maybe even finish your project if you get lost in one feature and neglect the rest of them. Setting yourself personal deadlines is another skill in its self. Simple to do but sticking and meeting them is the most vital part.

            You also need to make sure you are adept enough to carry out the project you plan to do. Its pointless to plan to program a good system that works really well if you do not know how to comfortably do this beforehand. No one is a master of coding and can always learn something new but attempting to code a system without any experience of the code will result in failure to meet your goals. 
            
            If you have multiple people contributing to your project then you need to manage communication between yourself and them, and between each other. This is vital for efficient use of time and to avoid two people doing the same thing or making a system that is not able to be integrated. 
            Managing communication efficiently can give you options for collection and analysis of date. Storage of past communication and a way to retrieve them if and when needed. You can then monitor the communication of your team to analyse efficiency

        <h4>Planning for the webpage</h4>
        <p>I will learn how the skills I need to create a website. This includes HTML and CSS. I will then begin to make a basic shell for it with HTML to make sure all my content is there and seperated. I will then  I will research what makes a good looking website and have a look for some examples myself. I will then design the outlay for my website to give it a nice and sleek appearance.

        <h4>The risks that might impact digital projects</h4>
        <p>Digital projects can fail for a number of reasons. Such as miscommunication. You can have the most talented team in the world but if the team does not communicate effectively then you project will likely fail. This is something that needs to be kept on top off to make sure everyone is on the same page at all times. Some projects are ill conceived. They are either too ambitious, or simply not detailed enough to meet a reasonable end goal. 1/5th of all projects fail right out the gate due to the project being considered a waste of time. 

            Another way projects fail. Is that that aren’t tested out the intended user. Having a project that solves the problem is great but if its difficult to use or adapt to for the actual user then its not going to be used effectively or maybe even at all. And if after months of training, your project is still difficult to use. It will just be abandoned. 
            
            A large reason for failure is underestimation of what is needed for the project to be done and how longs these things may take. This can either be undershooting the time frame for making a particular part. Which can cause major set backs and really demotivate a team. Which then causes further problems later in the project. Or it can be underestimating how hard a project will be. This can grind the process to a halt and really has the danger off destroying a projects chances of success.

        <h4>How I go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h4>
        <p>If I was selecting some software for a job I would make sure I run through a few things first. I would first make sure that the software is user friendly and can be used by all members of the team. I would also make sure that if we had to learn how to do something new with the code that it was both reasonable to learn and didn’t take up a lot of time to do so as this would impact the project.

            It is vital that the machine that you are trying to run your project on is capable of it and won’t crash randomly. Its important to test your code of the intended system to make sure porting the code over to it does not break anything. 

            I will also use slack to communicate if I come to a problem I don’t know how to solve and also to help my classmates if they are stuck. This will also give me a chance to see if the way I am coding can be done in a better more efficient way. I will use the text editor VSC for HTML to craft my website. VSC is a great text editor because it has the ability to import numerous languages such as python. For the website I will be using HTML and CSS

        <h4>Analysis on how my chosen technologies have helped me achieve my outcomes.</h4>
        <p>Trello is a great tool for planning and has helped me to visualise all the different elements I need for my website. It has allowed me to keep tabs on what I need to do, lets me focus on certain items with a doing list and lets me see a list of all the items that I have done. It also gives me the option, if I’m working with a team, to assign different cards to different members to allow efficient use of time. I could also add comments to be more precise.

            Git is a great tool used widely by programmers and developers for version control. Allowing you to always have access to the most up to date and working version of your code. I git, every working version of you code is a repository. Where you can then find a full history of all the changes that have been made. As git is  so popular, it has great community supper with a vast base of users. There are a multitude of tutorials, podcasts and video tutorials. Github is a git repository hosting service. However it adds a lot of its own features. 
            It provides a web based graphical interface for git. And provides access control and collaboration features like wikis and forms of task management for your projects. What make Github so powerful is the fork, pull request and merge commands, this allows easy updates of code and the ability for you to copy code from a repository, without having writing access, modify it and then send a pull request to the original owner. It can then be merged wit the original repository.

        <h4>How GDPR impacts digital projects </h4>
        <p>GDPR is outlined in 8 basic rules. The right to access, this means the individual has the right to access their personal data and how their date is used by the company if requested.

The right to data portability, meaning the transfer of their data to another service provider in a commonly used and readable machine format. The right to be informed, which covers any gathering of their data by companies, the individual must be informed before this happens and consent must first be given.
            The right to have information corrected, making sure that all data held by the company is accurate and up to date. The right to restrict processing, requesting that your data is held,  but not used. The right to object, this gives the right of the individual to stop the processing of their data for direct marketing, it must happen as soon as the request in received without exception.

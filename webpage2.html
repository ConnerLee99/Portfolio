        <h4>Website Planning</h4>
        <p>For the home page. I will welcome people to my website. Beneath this is was have a part for about me. The writing will be all white against a high contrast black background to make the text really stand out. Having the text white and the background dark will help to limit eyestrain for any user that is in a relatively dark environment. For the 2nd page I will have all of my Unit 1 outcome 1, down the centre of the screen. This will share also have the high contrast text-background. I will have a link at the bottom right of the page which will link to outcome 2 and 3 as they are both reviewing the tools I used and the website itself. I will also have a link to Unit 2 Outcome 1. I also want to include a page that runs the python game I made in full. My review page will be similar format to the others.
